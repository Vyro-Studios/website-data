      "content": "# Configuration\n\nVyro Shops uses a flexible and well-structured configuration system defined in `Config.lua`. All configuration is handled through shop tables that define items, locations, and interaction targets.\n\n## Config.lua Structure\n\nThe Config.lua file contains all your shop definitions organized by shop identifier:\n\n```lua\nConfig = {}\n\nConfig.Shops = {\n    [\"shop_identifier\"] = {\n        shopName = \"Display Name\",\n        currency = \"legal\",\n        items = { ... },\n        locations = { ... },\n        targets = { ... }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Shop Configuration Options\n\nEach shop entry contains the following properties:\n\n### Basic Properties\n\n`shopName` (string, required)\nThe display name of the shop shown to players in the UI.\n\n```lua\nshopName = \"General Store\"\n```\n\n`currency` (string, required)\nSpecifies which currency the shop accepts. Options:\n- `\"legal\"` - Uses standard player money\n- `\"illegal\"` - Uses black money\n\n```lua\ncurrency = \"legal\"\n```\n\n### Blip Configuration (optional)\n\nThe `blip` table adds a map marker/GPS point for the shop. If omitted, no blip will appear on the map:\n\n```lua\nblip = {\n    id = 59,          -- Blip sprite ID\n    colour = 69,      -- Blip color\n    scale = 0.8       -- Blip size scale\n}\n```\n\n**Blip Properties**:\n- **`id`** (number): The blip sprite ID (determines the icon appearance)\n- **`colour`** (number): The color ID for the blip\n- **`scale`** (number): The size scale of the blip (0.5 = small, 1.0 = normal, 1.5+ = large)\n\n### Model Connection (optional)\n\nThe `models` array allows the shop to interact with specific game models, such as vending machines. When players interact with these models, they'll open the shop:\n\n```lua\nmodels = { `prop_vend_soda_02`, `prop_vend_fridge01`, `prop_vend_water_01` }\n```\n\n**Use Cases**:\n- Vending machines for quick purchases\n- ATMs for currency exchange\n- Vendor props for specialized shops\n- Any interactive world model you want to assign to a shop\n\nWhen this property is used, the `targets` array can be left empty since the model interactions handle the zone definition.\n\n### Items Array\n\nThe `items` table contains all products available in the shop:\n\n```lua\nitems = {\n    {\n        name = \"Water Bottle\",\n        price = 5,\n        amount = 50,\n        weight = 10\n    },\n    {\n        name = \"First Aid Kit\",\n        price = 20,\n        amount = 10,\n        weight = 15\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Item Properties**:\n- **`name`** (string): The item identifier from your inventory system (ox_inventory or qb-core)\n- **`price`** (number): The price players pay to purchase this item\n- **`amount`** (number): Maximum stock available for this item\n- **`weight`** (number): Item weight in your inventory system\n\n### Locations Array\n\nThe `locations` table defines shop marker positions on the map:\n\n```lua\nlocations = {\n    vec3(25.7, -1347.3, 29.5),\n    vec3(-48.5, -1757.2, 29.4)\n}\n```\n\nEach location is a 3D coordinate where a shop marker will appear. You can have multiple locations for the same shop.\n\n### Targets Array\n\nThe `targets` table defines interaction zones where players can open the shop:\n\n```lua\ntargets = {\n    {\n        loc = vec3(25.06, -1347.32, 29.5),\n        length = 0.7,\n        width = 0.5,\n        heading = 0.0,\n        minZ = 29.5,\n        maxZ = 29.9,\n        distance = 1.5\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Target Properties**:\n- **`loc`** (vec3): The center location of the interaction zone\n- **`length`** (number): The length of the interaction box (X-axis)\n- **`width`** (number): The width of the interaction box (Y-axis)\n- **`heading`** (number): The rotation/heading of the interaction zone (0-360)\n- **`minZ`** (number): The minimum Z height of the interaction zone\n- **`maxZ`** (number): The maximum Z height of the interaction zone\n- **`distance`** (number): The distance at which the interaction prompt appears\n\n## Complete Examples\n\n### Traditional Shop with Targets and Blips\n\nA typical shop with multiple interaction zones and a map marker:\n\n```lua\nConfig.Shops = {\n    [\"general_store\"] = {\n        shopName = \"General Store\",\n        currency = \"legal\",\n        items = {\n            { name = \"Water Bottle\", price = 5, amount = 50, weight = 10 },\n            { name = \"Bread\", price = 3, amount = 30, weight = 5 },\n            { name = \"First Aid Kit\", price = 20, amount = 10, weight = 15 },\n        },\n        targets = {\n            { loc = vec3(25.06, -1347.32, 29.5), length = 0.7, width = 0.5, heading = 0.0, minZ = 29.5, maxZ = 29.9, distance = 1.5 },\n            { loc = vec3(-3039.18, 585.13, 7.91), length = 0.6, width = 0.5, heading = 15.0, minZ = 7.91, maxZ = 8.31, distance = 1.5 },\n        },\n        blip = {\n            id = 59,\n            colour = 69,\n            scale = 0.8\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Vending Machine Shop with Model Connection\n\nA shop that connects to physical vending machine models in the world:\n\n```lua\nConfig.Shops = {\n    [\"vendingmachinedrinks\"] = {\n        shopName = \"Vending Machine\",\n        currency = \"legal\",\n        items = {\n            { name = \"water\", price = 10, amount = \"ox\", weight = \"ox\" },\n            { name = \"soda\", price = 5, amount = \"ox\", weight = \"ox\" }\n        },\n        targets = {},\n        models = { `prop_vend_soda_02`, `prop_vend_fridge01`, `prop_vend_water_01`, `prop_vend_soda_01` }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Configuration Tips\n\n- **Use the Shop Maker UI** to generate proper configurations automatically - it handles all formatting and ensures correctness\n- **Item Names**: Must match identifiers in your inventory system (ox_inventory or qb-core)\n- **Amount/Weight**: You can use `\"ox\"` as a string to automatically pull weight values from your ox_inventory system\n- **Currency Types**: Choose between legal (regular money) and illegal (black money) for each shop\n- **Blips**: Optional map markers that help players locate shops. Omit the blip table if you don't want a marker\n- **Model Connection**: Perfect for vending machines, ATMs, and other interactive props - allows players to interact with the model to open the shop\n- **Multiple Targets**: You can define multiple interaction zones for a single shop to cover different entrances or counters\n- **Model-Only Shops**: Leave the `targets` array empty when using model connections\n- **Export Configs**: Use the UI's export feature to download or copy configurations directly into Config.lua",
